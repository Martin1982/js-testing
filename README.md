JavaScript Testing Training Project
====

This is a small demo project to compliment the JS testing materials used in my conference sessions. 
You may use this project for anything you like, there are no restrictions whatsoever on the code, 
however, the libraries used (jQuery and QUnit) have their own licesnes which you must comply with.

## How do I use this repository?

Clone the repo, refactor the code, and start writing tests!

You can find the [conference session slides](http://bit.ly/testing-js) online and refer to them for 
information on general JavaScript testing principles. There is a branch named `final-solution` 
which you can checkout to see how I refactored the code and implemented tests, but note that this 
solution was intentionally simple and by no means everything you could do.

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
